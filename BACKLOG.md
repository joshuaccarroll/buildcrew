# Backlog

This file contains the task backlog for the Josh Workflow automation.

## How to Use

1. Add tasks as checklist items: `- [ ] Task description`
2. Run `./workflow.sh` to process tasks automatically
3. Tasks are processed from top to bottom (first match wins)
4. Completed tasks are marked: `- [x] Task description`
5. Blocked tasks are marked: `- [!] Task description (blocked: reason)`

## Task Format

Write clear, actionable task descriptions:
- **Good**: `Implement user login with email/password authentication`
- **Bad**: `Add login` (too vague)

Include acceptance criteria when helpful:
- `Add search feature to product list (filter by name, category, price range)`

## Priority Levels

Organize tasks by priority using headers:

---

## High Priority

<!-- Add urgent tasks here - these will be processed first -->

- [ ] Example: Add error handling to API endpoints

## Medium Priority

<!-- Add standard tasks here -->

- [ ] Example: Refactor user service to use repository pattern

## Low Priority

<!-- Add nice-to-have tasks here -->

- [ ] Example: Add loading animations to buttons

---

## Completed

<!-- Completed tasks are automatically moved/marked here by the workflow -->

## Blocked

<!-- Tasks that couldn't be completed automatically -->
